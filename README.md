# Python_Minimal_C2
This is a project used to make a quasi C2 server. 
## Server
The server portion will take connections on two ports: one for messages and the other for files. 

## Clients
The Client files are for performing those activites. One is for compressing and transmitting files and the other is for sending messages. The intention was to run these as scheduled tasks.
